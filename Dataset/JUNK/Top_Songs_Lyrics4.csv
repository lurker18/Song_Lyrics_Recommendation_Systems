30 For 30 Freestyle,Drake,"Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were
to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4, 000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes
from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves

In the pourin' rain

That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night

Or dance around the fireplace

And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California

Break Up In A Small Town,Sam Hunt,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Your mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

from a ball cap in a pick up, seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, she got the man

Yeah there's an old you that I knew,
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Back woods on a four wheel, hanging on tight,
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future and I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy and she got the man

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore

Sorry,Justin Bieber,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Tennessee Whiskey,Chris Stapleton,"Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
‘Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing

This life's not easy

Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure

Learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like

We Went ,Randy Houser,"Black pontiac with a pocket of cash

like a pick up truck
does in the mud but ain't nobody slowing' us down

She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going
quite like you do when you doin the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town
something to talk about

Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence
jumped in a ditch
felt so good
We didn't want it to end
so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancin'
Did't take long, just a couple of songs
You know it's last call when the law comes walkin' in

So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence
jumped in a ditch
felt so good
We didn't want it to end so we went

Rocking to the radio
fogging up the windows
Headlights off
In a spot nobody else knows

Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,"For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

Purpose,Justin Bieber,"Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent
my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it's wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can't be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that's not who you are. You know you're trying to be the best you can be, but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That's what happening with me, it's like ""God, I'm giving it all I've got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it."" And it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding that's how it is",Pop

Life Is Worth Living,Justin Bieber,"Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now

Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out

He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living

Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in

Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow

Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead

Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness

People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see

They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me

Remedy  ,Adele,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you, love you
But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool

That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things

I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down

You've got a way of doing little things that really turn me on

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down
When a whole lot of Decembers are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place
You'll still be beatiful and I'll still be around
And if I can't I know that I'd still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear

Game plan solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now nothing less is adequate
Grab and check, cashing it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
What you think I pay for nothing?
You must be mistaken someone
I had to go make that fund and I'm trying to be great at something
Spend not, saving nothing

Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle

No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?

Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces

Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in

But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother

One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightning hands

And they'll all wanna dance
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandana; she was hotter than the devil's Hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers, Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions, so he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
I tried to file my points, sand my edges, and I just grew out my hair

They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was

If it ain't that same old, been-done kind

Break On Me.,Keith Urban,"There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl

Put your head on my chest

When your heart needs to break

Confession ,Florida Georgia Line,"Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Cloud of dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway

Heartbeat,Carrie Underwood,"I love it when we're at a party
In a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby
With the music up loud
Red wine, good times
No, I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I
I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in the firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket in the background
Underneath the harvest moon

Standing on your shoes in my bare feet

Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

Oh, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum
Beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me
And make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a falling star wish
One more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?
And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in the firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound

I wanna feel it like a kick drum
Beating faster in your chest
And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in the firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background
Underneath the harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh",Country

Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes

Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday

And every night your Valentine…

Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me

Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Rappin' bottles spin, I'm supplin' 10
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' 'round the city, you know what it is

Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just side yelling you not that important
Waist shaper I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tarter, I'mma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient

Under Pressure  ,Queen & David Bowie,"Pressure, pushing down on me
pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
splits a family in two, puts people on streets

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""let me out""
Tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days, it never rains but it pours

People on streets
People on streets

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, ""let me out""
Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high!
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep comin' up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?

Love (love, love, love, love)
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
give love, give love, give love, give love, give love
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for the people on the
edge of the night, and love dares you to
change our way of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves.

Drunk On Your Love  ,Brett Eldredge,"The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love

7 Years,Lukas Graham,"Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely.
Once I was seven years old.

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old.

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old.

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later.

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old.

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming.
Soon we'll be 30 years old.

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once

I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Something In The Way You Move,Ellie Goulding,"It's the strangest feeling
Feeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I'm never healing
It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
I don't know what it is you do
Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire
I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

The stars don't shine tonight, no
It's something in the way you do
It's something in the way you
Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing left for me to lose
There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

Can I get an Amen

When Hank reads the sermon

It gets my cold cold heart burning

Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling

Until my sins wash away

I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, and your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah

All I Ask,Adele,"I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is


If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

[Verse 2]
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or unjust
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is...

Never Forget You,Zara Larsson & MNEK,"I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die
('til the day I die)

'Til the day I die
('til the day I die)

Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think
could ever take you off my mind
(take you off my mind)
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through

So gather all the rebels now, we'll rebel-rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead

We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way (say hey, hey, hey)
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
Let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

Piece By Piece  ,Kelly Clarkson,"And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport
Leaving us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me
But you didn't want to

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And no, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me

Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself
And now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn't free
It has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed
So I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things
And piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old

And no, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me

Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...
Piece by piece...

Piece by piece
I fell far from the tree
I would never leave her like you left me
She will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first
And no, he'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

We be walking up the stairs
with the neighbors saying keep it down
But its hard to unblock the door when you're making out
You be saying that we gotta quit doing this
So why you leaning in for one more kiss
and pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
and slipping in to my T-shirt

Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs,
keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
Gettin' even with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember why we came here to forget...

Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through

Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her

And find a way to runaway with her heart

In the bar just lookin' for luck
In a pair of oh my blue eyes

Ain't never gonna quit playin' on and on and on
Well it's ""Chris loves Jenny"" on a license plate
It's daddy gettin' mad cause you came home late

So I can turn it up, and maybe turn her on

If I could make a living walking in the woods
You could bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sitting there reeling 'em in

A huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day

Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning and late in the evening

Well I'd get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I back it up
And pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke

I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree

Tuking her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
And w get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)

Wasted Time,Keith Urban,"The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back
To when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
Had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the (?) and the game

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had the guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sipping on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe

But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me

Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe

I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing

Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined

I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem

Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime

Just to see how you was feelin'

Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets

They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right

Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra

I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing to never lose me
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin' make sure you tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone then I gots to know now

Remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow, Ohhh, ohhh!

Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her tellin' me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keepin' people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
All these hand outs, man it's gettin' outta hand
I'ma start tellin' niggas, ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend

Trust me when I say that shit is old moves

So you can't drive it, and put on mileage

Weston Road Flows,Drake,"One of dem ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back to where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me

But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' was for me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me

Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'

Keep The Family Close,Drake,"It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me


All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore


Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end


And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine


You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on


And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine


You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day


All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't your rainbow

Something tells me, I know nothing at all
i've escaped my capture

A promise with a lie, is broken by design
What i thought i knew, has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame, right before it rains

Views,Drake,"Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at JD's connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm getting straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck being all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like a front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards them goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think running this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talking in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales
Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Running through the 6, storming through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either",Hip-Hop/Rap
Can't Stop The Feeling!,Justin Timberlake,"I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
You gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you

Church Bells,Carrie Underwood,"Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing",Country

Down That Road  ,Alisan Porter,"If you wanna give up, take a chance

But I can't show you how
Only you can turn the light on

It may be dark and winding
But it leads you home

Nothing comes easy but it won't always be
No, it won't be always be so hard

Good to go when she grabs your hand

Whiskey on her lips and the night's on fire

July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night's on fire

She's a seat laid back, a boy's dream
Drawin' hearts in the window steam
She's a gettin' you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what you're headed to

Causing a chain reaction


Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know


Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la


We...we'll be alright
Living our lives
Finding some satisfaction
No, we're gonna hide
No fear from our eyes
Love is a call to action

Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know


Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping
When the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed
I'm dancing face to face with a stranger
A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just
Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
You came in as a question until the music completed it
Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot
But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love
(Love make the world go round)


Cannot be killed or swept aside
(Love make the world go round)
And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ""you're out of time.""
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the menace and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely

It's gone before it ever melts the ice

Another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I'll wear a tail like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't proceed me

Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice

Another town, where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call, another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mmm, another vice

Standing at the sink now, looking at the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mama Said,Lukas Graham,"Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was OK
Mama told us we are good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on this stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright

And it was OK
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones

'Cause we were good kids

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted the deal in Hollywood
I told them I'll be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids they started bugging me
But now they're all standing right in front of me

When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was OK
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That's where I go
An old friend can give advice
When new friends only know a half story
That's why I'm always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm OK

You know what she told me

A Little More Summertime,Jason Aldean,"They boarded up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

If that sun had just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little
Just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in
Like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

If that sun had just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little
Just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at her feet
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in

Middle Of A Memory  ,Cole Swindell,"Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

We were gonna dance till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light

Castaway,Zac Brown Band,"Pour me another one
Make it a strong one

Rather stay and watch the waves 
move the sand beneath my feet

Is a damn good reason for keeping
Your back to the wind
That needle pinned

Ride on with your knees
Digging in to your saddle
Like a bat out of hell
Got the world by the tail
When it feels that good to be gone
Ride on

I always act like I don't care
When the blacktops going nowhere
Keep my head down, tough it out
Don't think about how life ain't fair

Ride on with your cold
Chrome and metal
Ride on with your knees
Digging in to your saddle
Like a bat out of hell
Got the world by the tail
When it feels that good to be gone
Ride on

Full speed ahead
Forget the breaks
Slam the gas
Don't look back

I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts

Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then

We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then

No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you...meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again

Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Scream my name

Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates

Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard me dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here

Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"She just wants to be, beautiful
She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits
She craves, attention she praises, an image
She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry, after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, ""covergirls eat nothing""
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer"", she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Ah oh, ah ah oh,
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
(No better you than the you that you are)
No better life than the life we're living
(No better life than the life we're living)
No better time for your shine, you're a star
(No better time for your shine, you're a star)
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautifu-u-u-ul

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh,

in a yellow cab shooting me a text saying ""coming home soon""
As long as I can bet on ya crawling into bed after slipping out your high heel shoes
I ain't lying, saying ""Have a good time,
out with your girls, girl do what you do""
No matter how late, baby I'll be staying up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossing and turning all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tired without you by my side
I'd be dreaming with my eyes open
I'd be tossing and turning all night babe

It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Because if the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it's wrong
That I can't move on
But there's something about you

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you

I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around in circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away

Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds


I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving round make me feel better


I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away
Don't you cry baby


Away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

Before we got used to usual

It might seem superficial, stereotypical, man

Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes
But I, I'll ride that wave with you
It's human nature to miss what's under your nose
'Til you, 'til you remind a fool

Maybe all of this is simple
My heart's unconditional, yeah
You dress up just a little and I'm like, ""Ohhh, damn""

Today,Brad Paisley,"When I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
Well I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back outta your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life

Well I know it won't always be like this
Life can change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

And as the seasons change and time goes by
When your hair is grey and so is mine
know for sure that you're gonna be just as beautiful
As you are to me today.

Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

Because the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life",Country
Million Reasons,Lady Gaga,"You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show

If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Giving me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Giving me a million reasons

Can't you give me what I'm needing, needing?

Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who has seen the Light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

No Heart,21 Savage & Metro Boomin,"Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my card
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'till a nigga get killed
'till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating""
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells

Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt

Likes to drink and smoke some doja
And I feel like smokin'
Plus she good at charmin' cobras
I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia
She be actin bougie
The she came through and topped me off
Now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the mafia
Her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no no

Dollar signs, yeah, I know its what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Yall ain't foolin me at all

I been at this shit for 9 years, now they startin' to call
Im a DIY pioneer, they tryna get involved
Yippee kiyay, aw yeah, 'bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one yea
Come correct when you approach me, I can size you up
Takin all the shots like Kobe, almost 81
Guess I gotta play the goalie and go and save me some
I'm proabably the only one, ye-ah

Who wants my money, I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pullin' strings, I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talkin like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me
Dollars, lotta stock in me
It ain't nothin personal
It's business and I'm a commodity
But honestly, Pop Pop would be turnin' in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss in me, I'll be damned

Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
[Chorus]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth it's weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
Cause it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go

Better Man  ,Little Big Town,"I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I'd run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye

"Two Birds, One Stone",Drake,"Yeah, more, yeah

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmation
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places

In a drop S coupe and I'm wheelin' nigga
Five hundred for the piece how I'm feelin' nigga
In the hood just chillin' nigga
I've seen realest niggas turn emotional all in they feelin' niggas
That's why I ain't really feelin' niggas
And if them hoes fuck with rats I ain't sayin' nothin' to them bitches
I guess I ain't really for them bitches really I'm blessed

I got God watchin' over me from courtside ballin' like I'm Jordan cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost cause I'm blessed up
I'mma do the most cause I'm blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood now we all eatin' good like we should cause we blessed up

Blessings, you niggas stressin'
Mac on the dresser when I'm dressin' and never pressure
Crab in the barrel watch the bucket don't let 'em catch you
Cause if they pull you back to the bottom know you gon' suffer, fuck 'em
I done leveled up on 'em 'til where I cannot touch em
Therefore can't feel 'em, therefore I'ma hustle
New Wraith on forgis, course that's from the muscle
Course I got a bubble, new Porshce red like a devil
Go skrt skrt through the lane on you
Niggas broke and you faker than that chain on you
I told Tak when he see you go insane on you
Can't D me call it man, I clear the lane on you
Change the speed game 7 'Bron James on you
My little niggas begging me to put that flame on you
You get some money watch how all these niggas change on you
That's why I changed on 'em I don't feel a thing for them nigga I'm blessed

I got God watchin' over me from courtside ballin' like I'm Jordan cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost cause I'm blessed up
I'mma do the most cause I'm blessed up

Bounce Back,Big Sean,"If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I’m homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks

D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga fuck what you know
Nigga I’m takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off

Hallelujah  ,Leonard Cohen,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say, I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you

They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes

One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying, cuz they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, a zany act, a maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming rills of roaches, when sprayed in this infections
Twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...

You heard of hell, well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it

But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces

My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

You heard of hell, well I was sent from it

I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Man I got evidence, I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic nestler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer. My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching

This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...

To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
There’s a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you think you’re going down
Just know I will be around

Reminder,The Weeknd,"Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow

I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low mane (low mane, low mane)

You know me, know me
You know, man, know, man, know, man
You know me, know me, know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me, know me (pow, pow)
You know me, know me

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit

Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG

All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know

Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause you know me

You know me, know me
You know, man, know, man, know, man
You know me, know me, know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me, know me (pow, pow)
You know me, know me (know me, know me)

Why don't you shake some, shake somethin' for the Don?
Don't you break nothin', break nothin', baby girl
Won't you work some, work somethin' for the Don?

How Far I'll Go,Auli'i Cravalho,"There's a line where the sky meets the sea
And it calls me
But no one knows
How far it goes

All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own
To worlds unknown

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Is a choice I make, now I can't turn back
From the great unknown where I go alone
Where I long to be

See her lie with the night in the sea
She calls me
And yes I know that I can go

There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me
Soon I'll know how far I'll go",Soundtrack

You're Welcome  ,Dwayne Johnson,"Ok, ok, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demi-god
What can I say except, ""You're welcome""
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Hey
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yea high?
This guy
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees
So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel
I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson?
What is the take-away?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hey)
Well, anyway let me say, ""You're welcome"" (you're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (you're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go (hey)
Hey, it's your day to say, ""You're welcome"" (you're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (you're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float
You're welcome

You're welcome

How Far I'll Go,Alessia Cara,"I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Though I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll...

Go-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I know, everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go",Soundtrack
False Prophets  ,J. Cole,"Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away
Due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half-ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizing niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite the shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it; false prophets

I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, the shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me? False prophets

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category
As a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones
Who listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real god is in you, not the music you coppin'

Dirt On My Boots,Jon Pardi,"Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to paid
Been hotter than a thousand suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more roads and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave or a shower
And I'll be outside your house

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
[Verse 2]
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light, the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
I be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Immortal,J. Cole,"Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA, in that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged

Yeah, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologized if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune—well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though, the fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' you do you and I do me
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape; death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate, even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
Don't follow me, don't follow me
Don't follow me, don't follow me

Yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness—God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'd never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (come from inside)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my chosen religion: Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God; I'm going hard nigga

[Verse 3]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth
Until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Verse 4]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 5]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22

We're gathered here today...

We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers

We know he's in a better place

Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how about that?

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only—

[Verse 2]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this, unfortunately
Means that I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not—I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance, at a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up—drug-related—mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a time sheet, that slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina"", the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand—

[Hook]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only—

[Verse 3]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGuax & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only—

[Verse 4]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing when times was hard
I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your Momma, nigga; send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects—""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I've been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes only",Hip-Hop/Rap
Foldin Clothes  ,J. Cole,"I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I, walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I—I see a lot on your plate
9 months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 2]
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice of being present
There's no where I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Foldin' clothes, watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows, eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk (""You soft!"")

If I can make life easier, the way you do mine
Save you some time, alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax, let you recline babe
Then I should do it, cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see it's the simple things
It's the simple things, it's the simple things
Now say, ""I love you""—it's the simple things
It's the simple things, it's the simple things

Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say:
""Damn, what’s gotten into you?""
Just trying to make it dog, somehow
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like maybe
Everything is gon' be alright",Hip-Hop/Rap

Handcuffs keep huggin the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor
Who be knockin' on they door every Black Friday
Just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell, where's your diaper shit here
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift, into a place that I can see
Someone more important than me?
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me?

Don't wanna die, cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side

Around until we found a place to stay and waste the day away
We'd do nothing but it was okay with me

Thinking about you so late at night
But I can't stop once I start it's like an avalanche

Hold your breath, I'm going under

We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

Castle On The Hill  ,Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but

I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill",Pop

But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it

Drinkin' Too Much,Sam Hunt,"Oh I drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Go for more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like

I'm sorry I named the album Montevallo
And I'm sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I'm sorry you can't listen to the radio
And drive out to the place where we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And you've got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay of your student loans
To these songs you gave to me
Remember the first time you stayed with me
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMA's with me
Two years later it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk
Barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'till you're not around
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'till you're not around

A year ago I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever ok to lie
Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water, and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone
Singin' these songs are just something to do
Every dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love
It's the kind that you can't fall out of

Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'till you're not around
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'till you're not around

I know this might seem like a contradiction
The last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do
I don't know what I'm gonna say to you
But I know there ain't no way, I know there ain't no way
No there ain't no way we're through",Country

If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

Scared To Be Lonely,Martin Garrix & Dua Lipa,"It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on, holding on tonight?

My Old Man ,Zac Brown Band,"He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am

Owe me time, owe me sex

I got no regrets, you disrespect, disrespect
Only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back, it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me

How you dress and how you talk from me
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya

Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game
Pointing fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust
I don't wanna have a fake us

And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night

And just like that it all comes back.
Deja Vu.
Ohhh here I go again.
From the begining and ohhh I watch us fall to fast.
I cant escape the love we made, the fights we had.
Slamming doors and broken glass.
And just like that it all comes back to you.
Deja Vu.
Deja Vu.
I wont ever get used to watching me loose you, over and over again.
I've gotten good at pretending that I'm okay but up here in my head, I see your clothes on the carpet.
Your arms wrapped around me, on the floor in the living room, and I almost belived that I'm really here with you.
Just like that it all comes back, Deja Vu.
Ohhhh here I go again, from the begining and ohh I watch us fall to fast, I can't escape the love we made the fights we had.
Slamming doors and broken glass, just like that it all comes back, it all comes back to you and I were meant to be but only in a memory.
Your all I want, your all I see it all comes back.
Ohhh here I go again, from the begining and ohh I watch us fall to fast, I cant escape the love we made, the fights we had.
Slamming doors and broken glass.
And just like that it all comes back to you.

Money On You,Chris Blue,"Can we get a little up close and personal
Somewhere alone, Somewhere alone

Yours If You Want It,Rascal Flatts,"There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

[Verse 2]
Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

[Post-Chorus]
It's yours if you want it

[Bridge]
Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it

[Chorus]
And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

The Dance,Lauren Duski,"Looking back on the memory of
The dance we shared 'neath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance

Holding you I held everything
For a moment wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance",Country

Yours,Russell Dickerson,"I was a boat stuck in a bottle
that never got the chance to touch the sea
just forgot on the shelf
no wind in the sails
going no where with no one but me

I was one in one-hundred billion
a burned out star in a galaxy
just lost in the sky wondering why
everyone else shines out but me
but.
I came to life when I first kissed you
the best me has his arms around you
you make me better than I was before

Thank God I'm yours

I was a worn out set of shoes
wandering the city street
another face in the crowd
head looking down
lost in the sound of a lonely melody
empty pockets at a roulette
always landing on a lost bet
just live for the spin and hope for the win
go all in just to lose again
but.
I came to life when I first kissed you
the best me has his arms around you
you make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
you put a new heart beat inside of me
you make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

This world has a way of shaking your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
‘Cause that's where her love gets in.

She gives me faith, she gives me grace
She gives me hope, she gives me strength
She gives me love, love without end
Thank God, for this woman, amen.

Thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness of sin and your undying love
Every twist, every turn for the way you made sure
All my roads led to her.

So, tonight I will fall down on my knees

1985 (Intro To The Fall Off),J. Cole,"1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' dissed me, I'm suprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya'
See if I can paint for you the larger picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin's black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your shows lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top

Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga",Hip-Hop/Rap
Window Pain (Outro),J. Cole,"One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

Right now I'm starin' out the window
of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occuptation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had changed
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the
muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, ""blaow, blaow!"", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny duff
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen,
it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, ""Don't forget me""
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell
you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is
realer than anything I done been through

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or he's tryna warn us of he's comin' back to,
um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um,
have us be his children and for us to see Him for the
first time so we can rejoice with him and have our time
And after we do that, he's gonna restart the world",Hip-Hop/Rap
Once An Addict (Interlude)  ,J. Cole,"Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause
part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home
early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush.
You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes of my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this
high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work it the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know
Why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals""
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of running

I Thought About Killing You,Kanye West,"I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you
Premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)

Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you
Premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)

I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good
To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really
Really bad things

And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits
Used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey
We was all born to die, nigga DOA
Niggas say they hero, mhm
I don't see no cape
Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah
I don't see no, mhm, mhm
If I wasn't shining so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay

Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke
I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth

Africa  ,Weezer,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

""Whatcha trying to prove?""
""Hey why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand and now everybody wanna die happy now

Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like ""Yoo-hoo"" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes, but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathias
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Steven Paddock with automatic stay spray
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs
Eight different ways, aim for the waist, you chumps don't
Even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat
If you had 'em choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feel like I'm headed for a padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
Then you better take it back to the shelter
And Hamburger Helper, 'cause damn it I'm still the

Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way I mispronounced the name
""DIE ANTWOORD!""
Fuck, I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs, you let your girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout, now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took, and rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop

Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
Revival didn't go viral
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the SIG lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee, you ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling

When something's in your mitochondrial

Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man

Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one

Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)

Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor

Take It From Me,Jordan Davis,"I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way, at my place, far away

Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulders
Now give them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me

Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes, all I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time

Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulders
Now give them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah

But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulders
Now give them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me

Take my kiss and maybe take it too far

What Makes You Country  ,Luke Bryan,"People talkin' 'bout what is and what ain't country
What gives 'em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin' on the rain
We're all a little different, but we're all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cap tractor halling in bales
Backing in boats, fishing landlines
Running bird docks through the Georgia pines

Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Where you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a level church
Silver cream corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab by gun and get my outside on

Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear in on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cap tractor halling in bales
Backing in boats, fishing land lines
Running bird docks through them Georgia pines

Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kinda country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country",Country

Somebody to know
Somebody to have

And you're not here

I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels

I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I stop my vehicle, drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
That's all I want, other than air
Oxygen, air, financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want for me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, you see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

I'm your puppet, I don't know me

Rearview Town ,Jason Aldean,"Wipe the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it

It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it

It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town",Country
How Do You Sleep?,Sam Smith,"I'm done hating myself for feeling
I'm done crying myself away
I've gotta leave and start the healing
But when you move like that, I just want to stay

What have I become now?
Looking through your phone now, oh no
Love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight

Tell me how do you
Love will keep you up tonight
Tell me how do you

Oh no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm sticking around to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight

Tell me how do you (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight
Tell me how do you
Oh, love will keep you up tonight

Baby, How Do You Sleep when you lie to me?

We Were,Keith Urban,"We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn't wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine
And we were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
(We were) both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of a water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss it
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-mm
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night
Last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
""Pour Some Sugar On Me""
(We were) top down at Johnson's field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-mm
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
(We were) both feet hangin' out over the edge
To the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm, yes, I do
Friends say, ""Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her""
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep I still believe
That we were",Country
