Beautiful Life  ,Nick Fradiani,"These days, well they're lookin' up
We got so much to say
We got someone to love
We got good friends
They're so good to us
And haters can hate
And fakers can front

so we try to live
Like it's all we've got
‘Cause for all we know
This could be the last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights
Gives us just one perfect night
To say oh what a beautiful life
Oh oh oh
Oh what a beautiful life

Here it comes out of the dark
We've got nothing to fear
We've got nothing but heart
Can't just wait here
To see what it brings
We've got too many hopes
We've got too many dreams

And so we try to live
Like it's all we've got
‘Cause for all we know
This could be the last night of our lives
Gonna chase down our every desire
We blaze the night
With all we've been waiting for
All this time
Reaches such great heights

A Thousand Years,Sawyer Fredericks,"Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone,
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Kick The Dust Up,Luke Bryan,"Kick the dust up
All week long it's a farming town, they're making that money grow

Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road

They take one last lap around,

That sun up high goes down
and that song come on girl kick it on back, Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where there ain't nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a four door burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out, baby watch your step now, better have your boots on.

Kick the dust up

back it on up
fill your cup up

Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up.
Bar downtown they got a line of people way out the door.

10 dollar drinks, it's packed inside, I don't know what they're waiting for.
Got me a jar full of ‘Clear, and I got that music for your ears
And it's like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where there ain't nobody,

We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a four door burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out, baby watch your step now, better have your boots on.
Kick the dust up

let's back it on up
fill your cup up
Lets tear it up up
And kick the dust up.
Come on
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge you oughta be glad you did.

Please  ,Sawyer Fredericks,"She's calling me, with a gentle touch
A love so real, it was far too much
For a boy like me, a worried mind
To believe in you, I gotta close my eyes

You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down on my knees

The will was strong, but my legs were weak
I could not walk and I could not speak
The love that you gave me was so way down south
Baby I was born just to kiss your mouth
You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees
Baby I can get down onto my knees
I can say please

So I became a part of you
And you became a part of me
See I had no choice but to lie to you, see
If I told you the truth, you'd have set me free

You'd have set me free
You want me to say, please
Baby I can say, please
You want me to get down on my knees

Old man look at my life,
Twenty four

Live alone in a paradise

Love lost, such a cost,
Give me things
that don't get lost.
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

Old man take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
and you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you.

I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past.
But I'm all alone at last.
Rolling home to you.

Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes

I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found, lost hope that I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, and I sing along

Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduce her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold

Makes me high
Can you feel it?

If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

I'm tripping over myself
I'm aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cause I'm finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every little touch
Reminds me how just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every little touch
Reminds me how just how much it all makes

Oh but these days, I'm on a mission
To get these wild oats out of my system.
Yeah I might stay out all night,
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right.

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty.
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Now I might have to kiss no telling how many lips
Before I ever really figure out what love is.
Go through some heartbreaks, wake up with headaches,
Don't learn nothing 'til you make a lot of mistakes.
How will I know where to draw the line
If I don't cross it a few hundred times?

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty.
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah I'm gonna stay out all night,
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right
I've gotta live a lot of life if I'm gonna give good advice
When I'm talking to my grand-babies
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise

Phenomenal  ,Eminem,"I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, ‘Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so

Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant

Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths

It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal

But I would never say, ‘Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it

Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at

And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood

With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths

It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal

But I would never say, ‘Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Step into the unknown and find yourself
You're floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue thats how, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation

The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath

Managed to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal

A couple cans all cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist, every favorite songs
When I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

So give me that aw yeah, and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss, wanna steal 'em from your lips baby, like a truck
Foot heavy on the floorboard, everywhere we go

Burning down these back roads

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
Ooh, baby you and me, just a-running down crazy
Flying high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

So give me that aw yeah, and I'll give you that all night

Can't Feel My Face  ,The Weeknd,"And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come

All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know
She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""

We both know we can't go without it

This Could Be Us,Rae Sremmurd,"Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Hey, Sremm life

I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I opened the door for her
She acted like a whore and I'ma let her
Learn from Project Pat uh pimpin' got her masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

So back to what I was saying (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make your girl go down)

New keys to drive this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before I let a girl touch anything
She gotta say please, say please
And I know they really wish we would ball til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf there's a full moon y'all
Toss the money in the air girl, watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibes should be a fuckin' crime
Wasting someone's time should be a fuckin' crime

Lose My Mind,Brett Eldredge,"You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane

Ghost Town  ,Adam Lambert,"Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out

Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer

And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected

Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire

And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a care if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town

Sparks  ,Hilary Duff,"I can't hear a single word
Just know you're talking ‘cause your lips keep moving
Everything I thought I learned
Goes out the window
All I want is one thing

You can promise castles, treasures, babies
I don't care
Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Ticking tocking like a bomb
Throws me back to when I had you closer
Skin to skin we get it on

Without the love I feel you going bolder
You can promise castles, treasures, babies
I don't care
Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck

You remember what I love so baby take me back
Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

You, you make my heart go

Take it all off
Want every inch of you
Traveling back in time
Tangled uptight

Just like we used to
Now do that thing I like
Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go

Real Life,Jake Owen,"Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
‘Cause there wasn't sh! t to do
We didn't know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
But our neighbor had a pool

We got green grass and two trees
Whoa oh oh oh oh
But it ain't like what's on TV
Whoa oh oh oh oh
This is real life in the real world
We ain't talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right
Real life

We got a dive bar
With a real band, they play too loud
And they're real bad
But we're real boys so we still dance
And we stay out way too late
Hit the Waffle House for some real food
But that waitress, she's real rude
She got real problems but we do too so we tip her anyway

That's just the way that it is Whoa oh oh oh oh
That's just the way that we live Whoa oh oh oh oh
This is real life in the real world
We ain't talking to no models
We got real girls
We get real low, we get real high
It ain't all good baby but it's all right

Yeah we're livin' real life

We find real love, get real hurt
Fall real hard, shake off the dirt
Pray to God, let's make a deal
I guess it just got real
We get real low, we get real high

Like I Can  ,Sam Smith,"He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand, but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand 'cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down on the wrong road
Mine is the heart, and the soul of this song
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
maybe, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down on the wrong road

Lord Knows  ,Meek Mill,"All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
My bitch so bad she on my Christmas list
Remember I prayed I really wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I with some niggas that remember we took some risks for this
I'm talking risky business flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows that if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They said I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
They spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church at your wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called to collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up but I did not give up
Cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game Philly as shit
Look at these rappers they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em because I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose came up from nothing
And now they like how he make millions so quick
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca

Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til Fox be on
Seeing then momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Steady moving on these niggas get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you trill, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city

I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it

I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long

Tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him

I know, you don't wanna break his heart, but that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart, look
just tell him, it's you, it ain't him
and maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in, but I know you ain't in love with him,
break up with him

I know that you so done with him, break up with him, break up with him
You would've hung up by now if you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do, but if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again, I know you ain't in love with him

The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him

Baby, we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us

Back and forth like a tug o' war
What's it all for? Do I want it back?
I still got a little flame for ya
Even though you drove me mad

Now and then, I pretend
That it's you when I close my eyes
You got yours, I got mine
But I wonder where you are tonight

It should've been us
Should've been a fire, should've been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Could've been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure

We were crazy, but amazing

It should've been us, us

Fly,Maddie & Tae,"Baby blue staring in the window pane
Just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she's got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress
Now her heart's a mess
Praying she will find a way to make it

So keep on climbing though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might brake
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
Cause you can't learn to fly

On the way down
Searching for the sun in the night even like a lonely string of lights

That'll burn just long enough for you to see it

Road's been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There's more to this than just the breath your breathing
So keep on climbing though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might brake
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
Cause you can't learn to fly

On the way down
On the way down

You won't forget the heavy steps you took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath and fly
Keep on climbing though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might brake
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
Cause you can't learn to fly
On the way down
Flyyyyyyyyy

Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain't holdin' nothin' these two hands
Until they're holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now

Save It For A Rainy Day,Kenny Chesney,"It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home

But today,
The tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay
And it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

Cause the sun's too bright,
The sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition
I knew I'd be missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit

Wondering what happened
Two days of taking all the blame
Got a drink, or two,
That's as fool proof as what it will be
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kind of making eyes at me

Cause the sun's too bright,
The sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good,
My friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you
I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

They'll be plenty of time for ones and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

Cause the sun's too bright,
The sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good,
My friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down

An antisocial pessimist
But usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be

Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message
(Like we usually do)

And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners

I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more

Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Tell Your Friends,The Weeknd,"We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they’re about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (About it)

Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill

[Verse 2]
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I’m talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Verse 3]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless

I've been ducking left and right
Baby you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying

Momma caught me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real)

But ever since I met you
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe

I'm not trying to talk at all
Cause I'm trying to love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins

In The Night,The Weeknd,"All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Babygirl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

But I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)

Are nothing but trouble
(But I don't know her Lord)
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models

Hold My Hand ,Jess Glynne,"Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK

Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh

Cause I don't wanna walk alone

Hide Away ,Daya,"Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother (Hey!)
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
He's gonna save my life like superman
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company

On My Mind  ,Ellie Goulding,"It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Though that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait, I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame, you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it

Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

And I still don't understand it

Moving in reverse with no way out
